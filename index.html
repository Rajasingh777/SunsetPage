        <h1>Sun Set Time </h1>
        <p>Arrive at the lake a little before the calculated sunset time to ensure you have enough time to find a good
            spot, set up any equipment, and settle in for the view. You may want to bring a blanket, some snacks, and a
            camera to capture the moment.</p>
